Advent of Code 2024
===================

This repository contains solutions to Eric Wastl's [Advent of Code
2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). When I solved the problems initially, I
wrote them in Python, but in some instances, I have gone back and written
solutions in other languages. The author of Advent of Code requests that
participants "don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or
your inputs," so only the solutions can be found in this repository. The code
for is generally optimized for writing efficiency, so in addition to solutions
being computationally non-optimal, vestigial code abounds, copying & pasting is
ever present, and variable names often do not make sense since the names might
not be changed even if the context in which they are used does.
